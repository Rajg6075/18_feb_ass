    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS= A1. An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of defined rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "It specifies how requests for certain functionalities or data should be made and how the responses will be structured.\n",
    "APIs enable developers to create applications that can leverage the capabilities of other software components without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in real life: Consider a weather applicatioQ2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.n on your smartphone. This app provides you with weather information for your current location or other places you're interested in. The weather app itself might not have all the data it needs to provide this information; it relies on an external service's API to retrieve up-to-date weather data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS= Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: APIs allow developers to build software applications by combining existing building blocks (APIs) rather than starting from scratch. This modularity promotes code reuse, accelerates development, and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time and Cost Savings: By utilizing APIs, developers can save time and money by avoiding the need to develop every functionality from scratch. This is especially valuable for complex features like payment processing, geolocation, or machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialized Expertise: APIs can provide access to specialized services and functionalities developed by experts in their respective fields. For instance, a payment gateway API allows an application to handle secure online payments without needing in-depth knowledge of payment processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ecosystem Expansion: APIs enable developers to extend the functionality of their applications by integrating third-party services. This expands the range of features an application can offer without having to develop them in-house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency: When an application relies heavily on external APIs, it becomes dependent on the availability and reliability of those APIs. If an API service experiences downtime or changes its functionality, it can disrupt the functionality of the dependent application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Concerns: Integrating external APIs can introduce security risks if proper precautions aren't taken. Inadequately secured APIs can expose sensitive user data or provide potential entry points for attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Issues: External API calls can introduce latency into an application, particularly if the API service is slow to respond. Overreliance on external APIs could slow down an application's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS= A Web API (Web Application Programming Interface) is a specific type of API that is designed to be accessed over the internet using the HTTP protocol. It provides a way for software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the web. Web APIs are typically used to enable communication between a client application (such as a web browser, mobile app, or desktop application) and a server-side application or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between API and Web API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "API (Application Programming Interface): An API is a general concept that defines how different software components should interact. APIs can use various communication protocols, such as local function calls, remote procedure calls (RPC), or network protocols other than HTTP.\n",
    "Web API (Web Application Programming Interface): A Web API specifically uses the HTTP protocol to enable communication between client applications and server-side services over the internet.\n",
    "Access Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "API: APIs can be designed for various types of communication, including local method calls within a program or more distributed communication across different systems.\n",
    "Web API: Web APIs are designed to be accessed over the web, making them accessible to clients from anywhere with an internet connection. They use URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to identify resources and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform actions on those resources.\n",
    "Location of Interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "API: APIs can facilitate interactions between components within a single application, between applications running on the same device, or even between applications on different devices connected through a network.\n",
    "Web API: Web APIs specifically facilitate interactions between client applications (which can be running on various devices and platforms) and server-side applications or services hosted on remote servers.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "API: APIs can be used for various purposes, including internal software design, integration between software modules, and communication between different software systems.\n",
    "Web API: Web APIs are used primarily for enabling communication between different software systems over the internet. They are commonly used to provide access to services like social media integration, payment gateways, databases, and more.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "API: A local programming language library that provides functions for file manipulation within an application is an example of an API.\n",
    "Web API: The Twitter API, which allows developers to programmatically interact with Twitter's features and data, is an example of a web API.\n",
